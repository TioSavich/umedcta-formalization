    ]).

%!      max_inferences(?Limit:integer) is nondet.
%
%       Defines the maximum number of inference steps the meta-interpreter
%       is allowed to take before a `resource_exhaustion` perturbation is
%       triggered.
%
%       This is a key parameter for learning. It is intentionally set to a
%       low value to make inefficient strategies (like the initial `add/3`
%       implementation) fail, thus creating a "disequilibrium" that the
%       system must resolve through reorganization.
%
%       This predicate is dynamic, so it can be changed at runtime if needed.
%
%       PRIMORDIAL MACHINE SETTING: Set to 20 to force early crisis.
%       The "Counting All" strategy will fail on add(8,5) which requires
%       25 enumeration steps, triggering resource_exhaustion and forcing
%       the first dialectical progression, while allowing 3+1 (11 steps) to pass.
:- dynamic max_inferences/1.
max_inferences(20).

%!      max_retries(?Limit:integer) is nondet.
%
%       Defines the maximum number of times the system will attempt to
%       reorganize and retry a goal after a failure. This prevents infinite
%       loops if the system is unable to find a stable, coherent solution.
%
%       This predicate is dynamic.

max_retries(5).

% --- Cognitive Cost Configuration ---

%!      cognitive_cost(?Action:atom, ?Cost:number) is nondet.
%
%       Defines the fundamental unit costs of cognitive operations for the
%       embodied mathematics system. This implements the "measuring stick"
%       metaphor where computational effort represents embodied distance.
%
%       Phase 6 Enhancement: Costs now implement theoretical commitments:
%       - Embodied representations (recollection lists) cost proportional to length
%       - Modal shifts represent cognitive events and consume resources
%       - Abstraction is measured as cost reduction vs enumeration
%       - These costs are NOT optimizations - they operationalize theory
%
%       Different actions have different cognitive costs based on their
%       embodied nature:
%       - unit_count: The effort of counting one item (high effort, temporal)
%       - slide_step: Moving one step on a mental number line (spatial, lower effort)
%       - fact_retrieval: Accessing a known fact (compressed, minimal effort)
%       - inference: Standard logical inference (abstract reasoning)
%       - modal_shift: Cognitive context transition (comp_nec, exp_poss, etc.)
%       - recollection_step: Manipulating one tally in embodied representation
%
%       This predicate is dynamic to allow learning-based cost adjustments.
:- dynamic cognitive_cost/2.

% Default cost for a standard logical inference (abstract reasoning)
cognitive_cost(inference, 1).

% Cost for an atomic, embodied counting action (temporally extended)
cognitive_cost(unit_count, 5).

% Cost for moving one unit on a mental number line (spatialized action)
cognitive_cost(slide_step, 2).

% Cost of retrieving a known fact (highly compressed, minimal effort)
cognitive_cost(fact_retrieval, 1).

% PHASE 6: Cost for modal state transitions (embodied cognitive shifts)
% Modal operators ($s(comp_nec(...)), $s(exp_poss(...))) represent
% actual cognitive events - reflection, restructuring, modal focus.
% Thinking is not free. Each modal shift consumes resources.
cognitive_cost(modal_shift, 3).

% PHASE 6: Cost for each tally in a recollection list
% Manipulating embodied representations (recollection([tally|...])) 
% costs effort proportional to list length. This models the physical
% effort of token manipulation. "Counting All" exhaustion is embodied
% exhaustion, not arbitrary resource limitation.
cognitive_cost(recollection_step, 1).

% Cost for normative checking (validating against mathematical context)
cognitive_cost(norm_check, 2).

%!      calculate_recollection_cost(+Recollection, -Cost) is det.
%
%       PHASE 6: Calculates the embodied cost of working with a recollection.
%       Cost is proportional to the length of the tally list, representing
%       the physical effort of manipulating tokens.
%
%       This operationalizes the theory that embodied representations
%       have inherent costs. Abstraction (learned strategies) reduces
%       this cost by working with compressed representations.
%
%       @param Recollection A recollection term: recollection([tally, tally, ...])
%       @param Cost The calculated cognitive cost

    is_list(TallyList),
    length(TallyList, Length),
    cognitive_cost(recollection_step, StepCost),
    Cost is Length * StepCost.

%!      calculate_strategy_cost(+StrategyTrace, -Cost) is det.
%
%       PHASE 6: Calculates total cost of a strategy execution.
%       This allows measuring abstraction as cost reduction.
%
%       Developmental progress = (Primordial Cost - Learned Cost) / Primordial Cost
%
%       @param StrategyTrace Execution trace of a strategy
%       @param Cost Total cognitive cost consumed
calculate_strategy_cost(StrategyTrace, Cost) :-
    % Placeholder - full implementation would analyze trace structure
    % and sum all cognitive costs (recollections, modal shifts, inferences)
    % For now, return a simple heuristic
    ( is_list(StrategyTrace)
    -> length(StrategyTrace, TraceLength),
       Cost is TraceLength * 1  % Simple heuristic
    ; Cost = 1  % Default
    ).

% --- Server Configuration ---

%!      server_mode(?Mode:atom) is nondet.
%
%       Defines the current server mode which controls which endpoints
%       and features are available.
%       - development: Full debugging and analysis endpoints
%       - production: Full-featured production server with all core endpoints
%       - testing: Limited endpoints for automated testing  
%       - simple: Self-contained endpoints without module dependencies
%
%       This predicate is dynamic to allow runtime reconfiguration.
:- dynamic server_mode/1.
server_mode(development).

%!      server_endpoint_enabled(?Endpoint:atom) is nondet.
%
%       Defines which endpoints are enabled based on the current server mode.
%       This allows fine-grained control over API availability.
