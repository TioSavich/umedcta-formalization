/** <module> Student Addition Strategy: Counting On
 *
 * This module implements the 'Counting On' strategy for addition, modeled
 * as a finite state machine. This is the first strategy children learn after
 * Counting All — instead of enumerating both addends, start at A and
 * iterate successor B times.
 *
 * Uses grounded arithmetic (add_grounded with recollections) for each
 * counting step. Each step costs one unit_count inference.
 *
 * DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE: This is the first strategy a learner synthesizes
 * from primitives. A learner with only successor can compose "iterate
 * successor B times from A" to get Counting On. It costs O(B) inferences,
 * which is cheaper than Counting All's O(A+B) but still linear — triggering
 * a crisis on multi-digit problems (38+55 costs 55 steps) that motivates
 * learning COBO or RMB.
 *
 * COUNTING EXPERIENCE: A learner that counts on through 0-100 experiences
 * every base-10 landmark (9→10, 19→20, ..., 99→100). This experiential
 * knowledge — "13 is 3 more than 10" — is what other strategies formalize
 * as mod(13, 10) = 3. The knowledge comes from counting, not from a
 * built-in function.
 *
 * The state of the automaton is represented by the term:
 * `state(StateName, CurrentValue, RemainingCount)`
 *
 * The history of execution is captured as a list of steps:
 * `step(StateName, CurrentValue, RemainingCount, Interpretation)`
 *
